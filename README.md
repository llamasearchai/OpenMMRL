# OpenMMRL: An Open-Source Multimodal Representation Learning Framework

OpenMMRL is a state-of-the-art, open-source framework for building and training multimodal models that can understand and process information from various modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. It is built on top of PyTorch and JAX/Flax, providing a flexible and scalable platform for research and production.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily swap out encoders, fusion mechanisms, and heads to experiment with different model designs.
- **Support for Multiple Modalities**: Pre-built encoders for text, images, audio, and video.
- **Advanced Fusion Techniques**: Implements cross-attention-based fusion for effective combination of multimodal information.
- **Distributed Training**: Integrated with DeepSpeed for efficient large-scale training.
- **Comprehensive Utilities**: Includes tools for experiment tracking (MLflow, W&B), visualization, and profiling.
- **Extensible**: Designed for easy extension to new modalities, models, and tasks.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenMMRL.git
    cd OpenMMRL
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start: Training a Model

1.  **Download your data:** Make sure you have your multimodal dataset available locally.

2.  **Configure your run:** Create a JSON configuration file based on the provided `configs/default_config.json`. Update the `data_dir` to point to your dataset.

    ```json
    {
        "model": { ... },
        "dataset": {
            "name": "your_dataset_name",
            "data_dir": "/path/to/your/dataset",
            "modalities": ["text", "image"],
            ...
        },
        "training": { ... }
    }
    ```

3.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train.py --config /path/to/your_config.json
    ```

    Checkpoints and logs will be saved to the `outputs/` directory.

## Architecture Overview

OpenMMRL follows a modular design that separates the key components of a multimodal model:

-   **Encoders**: Modality-specific networks that extract features from raw data (e.g., a ViT for images, a Transformer for text).
-   **Fusion Module**: A cross-attention-based module that combines the features from different modalities into a unified representation.
-   **Heads**: Task-specific layers that take the fused representation as input to produce the final output (e.g., a projection head for contrastive learning).

This modularity allows for great flexibility in designing and experimenting with different architectures.
